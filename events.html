        <figcaption>Peter Van Den Dungen in Rotterdam, next to the statue of Erasmus in Rotterdam</figcaption>
        <p class="publishing-content">Was born in Haarlem (1948) but grew up in Flanders, Belgium, Antwerp province. He studied Economics at the university in Antwerp and then International Relations at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies, first at the  Bologna Centre in Italy and then in Washington DC (MA). This was followed by doctoral studies at the Department of War Studies, Kings College, University of London (PhD 1975).</p>

        <p class="publishing-content">Shortly afterwards, Peter was appointed Lecturer in Peace Studies in the Department of Peace Studies, University of Bradford, West Yorkshire. The Department was established in 1973, following a successful appeal by Quakers that students should be able to study at university not only war, but also peace. The appeal raised half the funds necessary to establish a chair, the university contributing the other half. Bradford University has been Peter Van Den Dungen’s academic home until 2015. He has been teaching courses on peace history; the classical literature of peace; international organisation and international law; armament and disarmament; theories of international relations. Also peace education and cultures of peace.</p>

As a result of this nomination, in 2009, his first book&#8212;"<a href="http://www.dearahed.co.uk/"><em>Dear Ahed..... The Game of War and a Path to Peace</em></a>"&#8212;was published.

        <p class="publishing-content"><b>A film by Gwen Burnyeat and Pablo Mejía Trujillo about the Peace Community of San José de Apartadó. </b>Chocolate of Peace depicts the Peace Community of San José de Apartadó’s experiences of resistance, narrated by the protagonists’ testimonies, and via a journey through their processes of organic chocolate production. From the seed to the product, the cacao is the narrative thread that takes us through the Community’s stories of violence and resilience, and their fight to remain neutral in the face of the Colombian armed conflict. This film offers a panorama of hope, proof that despite great difficulties it is possible to sow peace through human and economic relationships. It invites us to rethink our relationship with food, to value the efforts of those who produce it, and to build bridges between the victims of the armed conflict and other sectors of global civil society.</p>

        <p class="publishing-content"><b>Gwen Burnyeat</b> is a Wolfson PhD Scholar in Anthropology at University College London, UK, doing research on the role of the state in the Colombian peace process. She is author of 'Chocolate, Politics and Peace-Building: An Ethnography of the Peace Community of San José de Apartadó, Colombia' (Palgrave Macmillan 2018) and producer/co-director of 'Chocolate of Peace' (2016). She has worked in Colombia for eight years, including with the International Centre for Transitional Justice, Peace Brigades International, Rodeemos el Diálogo, and as lecturer in Political Anthropology in the National University of Colombia, and has written about the peace process for the London Review of Books and Latin America Bureau.</p>
