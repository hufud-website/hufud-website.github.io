        <p class="publishing-content"><b>Peter van den Dungen</b> <br />Was born in Haarlem (1948) but grew up in Flanders, Belgium, Antwerp province. He studied Economics at the university in Antwerp and then International Relations at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies, first at the  Bologna Centre in Italy and then in Washington DC (MA). This was followed by doctoral studies at the Department of War Studies, Kings College, University of London (PhD 1975).</p>

        <p class="publishing-content">Shortly afterwards, Peter was appointed Lecturer in Peace Studies in the Department of Peace Studies, University of Bradford, West Yorkshire. The Department was established in 1973, following a successful appeal by Quakers that students should be able to study at university not only war, but also peace. The appeal raised half the funds necessary to establish a chair, the university contributing the other half. Bradford University has been Peter Van Den Dungen’s academic home until 2015. He has been teaching courses on peace history; the classical literature of peace; international organisation and international law; armament and disarmament; theories of international relations. Also peace education and cultures of peace.</p>
